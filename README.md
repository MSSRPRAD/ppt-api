# ToDoFlask
A basic ToDo App using Flask for learning purposes.

Features:
1) Login, Sign Up pages
2) Basic crud functionality (creating tasks, deleting tasks, creating users, deleting one's own account)
3) Uses flask_login for authentication purposes (Probably the most useful part of the repo). The code with only the auth is in the "auth" branch.
4) Basic Frontend
5) Uses sqlite for the database and sqlalchemy for accessing and managing it through python
