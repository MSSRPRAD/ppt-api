# PPT maker using ChatGPT

## Goal

1) To be able to generate a powerpoint presentation just from the prompt given.
2) Make a web application for easy access

## Current Status

Lots of bugs to fix but made a start.

1) Give prompt in chat.py
2) `python chat.py`
3) 'python ppt.py'
4) Open the `.pptx` file generated.

## Immediate Priority

1) Make a web application (probably using flask) and deploy it online (probably pythonanywhere.com)
2) Fix bugs (not easy as chatgpt response varies a lot)
